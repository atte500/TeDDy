# TeDDy CLI: A File-Based Front-End for Agentic Coding

TeDDy applies the **[UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)** to AI development and uses a **[Git-like workflow](https://git-scm.com/)** to embed the entire collaboration process directly into your file system. Inspired by **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**, your entire AI collaboration lives entirely in plain Markdown files in your local directory.

## **Guiding Principles**

### **1. Markdown Files as Interface**

With TeDDy, your interface *is* the file system. You interact with the AI through simple Markdown and text files that you can edit, search, and manage with the tools you already use every day. Your AI workflow lives and breathes alongside your code, not in a separate, siloed application.

### **2. Local-First & Data Ownership**

Your complete AI collaboration history resides on your machine in a simple, open format. There is no cloud service, no vendor lock-in. This gives you absolute control over your privacy and full ownership of your data. Your sessions are as portable, private, and permanent as the rest of your codebase.

### **3. Transparent & Hackable**

Every turn is completely auditable. This transparency extends to the AI's core behavior. Agent personas are defined in simple prompt files you can easily edit or create, allowing you to tailor the AI's skills, rules, and personality to perfectly fit your project's unique needs.

### **4. Human-Centric Workflow**
Instead of executing one action at a time, agents generate a complete `plan.md` file upfront, detailing their full rationale and every intended action. Once approved, actions are executed *deterministically* exactly as per plan. This approach keeps you firmly in the driver's seat and ensures alignment between you and the AI.
