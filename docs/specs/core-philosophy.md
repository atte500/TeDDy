# Obsidian for AI coding

TeDDy is your file-based front-end for agentic coding. It embeds the entire AI collaboration workflow directly into your local file system, letting you drive complex coding tasks without ever leaving your editor.

## **Guiding Principles**

### **1. Markdown Files as Interface**

Forget proprietary UIs or clumsy web chat windows. With TeDDy, your interface *is* the file system. You interact with the AI through simple Markdown and text files that you can edit, search, and manage with the tools you already use every day. Your AI workflow lives and breathes alongside your code, not in a separate, siloed application.

### **2. Local-First and Full Ownership**

Your complete AI collaboration history resides on your machine in a simple, open format. There is no cloud service, no vendor lock-in. This gives you absolute privacy and full ownership of your data. Your sessions are as portable, private, and permanent as the rest of your codebase.

### **3. Fully Transparent and Customizable**

Every turn is completely auditable. The `_context.log` file provides an unambiguous, byte-for-byte record of what the AI was shown, making your workflow perfectly reproducible. This transparency extends to the AI's core behavior. Agent personas are defined in simple prompt files you can easily edit or create, allowing you to tailor the AI's skills, rules, and personality to perfectly fit your project's unique needs.

### **4. Human-Centric Workflow**
The AI proposes, you decide. Specialized agents generate a transparent plan.md file, detailing their rationale and every intended action: from creating files to executing commands. Nothing happens until you give the final approval. This keeps you firmly in the driver's seat, ensuring the entire workflow is safe, predictable, and perfectly aligned with your intent.
