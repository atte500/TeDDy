# spikes/functional/01-read-action-contract/proposal.yaml
# ---
# Final, approved contract for the `read` action.

- action: read
  # The 'description' field is optional metadata for the human operator.
  # The AI does not need to generate it, and the executor can ignore it.
  description: "Read the content of a local file or a remote URL."
  params:
    # The 'source' parameter is unified. It accepts either a local file path
    # (e.g., "./path/to/file.txt") or a remote URL
    # (e.g., "https://example.com/page.html").
    # The executor is responsible for determining the source type.
